README for thomsoncrack

thomsoncrack is a small tool that can be used to generate 
default keys for some thomson routers using information 
found in the default SSID.

The executable accepts one argument; the identifying
string at the end of the SSID. For example, if the ssid was
"ThomsonCDEA15" then usage would be: `thomsoncrack CDEA15`.

The resulting output would look something like:

Serial: CP0911524243
Possible Key Found: 68510B64B3

Done!


thomsoncrack requires pthreads and uses libcrypto from openssl.

The source code is loosely based on the python script found at the following url:
