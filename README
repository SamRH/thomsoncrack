README for thomsoncrack

thomsoncrack is a small utility used to generate possible WPA
keys for thomson routers based off of information found 
in the default SSID.

The executable accepts one argument and that is the identifying
string at the end of the SSID. For example, if the ssid was
"ThomsonCDEA15" then usage would be: `thomsoncrack CDEA15`
The output would look somthing like:
Possible Key Found: 68510B64B3
Possible Key Found: B264B29568

thomsoncrack requires pthreads and uses libcrypto from openssl.

The source code is loosely based on the python script found at the following url:
